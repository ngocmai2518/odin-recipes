  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chocolate crinkle cookies have become a holiday staple, but they're also great any time of year. They're cake-like cookies made with unsweetened cocoa powder, vegetable oil, and a handful of other pantry staple ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before baking, the cookies are coated in confectioners' sugar. When they bake up, they end up with a cracked (or "crinkled") effect.
    </p>
    <P>
      They're the perfect cookie for brownie or Devil's food cake lovers because of their rich, fudgy flavor and texture.
    </P>
