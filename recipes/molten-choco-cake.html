  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is the original, supremely rich version of the iconic molten chocolate cake, created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten.

    <p>
      It seems as though every restaurant in America offers a version of this amazing chocolatey cake, but the original is in a class by itself. Molten chocolate cake became famous for a reason: It's cakey on the outside with an irresistible center of flowing warm dark chocolate. The first time you try one, it may seem like magic, but this chocolate molten cake recipe is actually quite easy to make and ready in under an hour. Be sure to use the finest quality chocolate — it will make a big difference.

    <P>
      These gooey, rich cakes are enough on their own, but you can serve them with sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream if you like.
